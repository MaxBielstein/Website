                I'm Max, a driven software engineer with extensive experience in cloud technologies. My journey began at 15
                when I started developing Minecraft plugins in Javaâ€”a spark that ignited my relentless pursuit of excellence
                and innovation.

                I earned my Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Currently
                based in Houston, I serve as a Software Engineer II for Principal Financial Group, where I contribute to
                developing robust and scalable cloud solutions. I approach every project with a proactive mindset and a
                get-stuff-done and do it right attitude, always striving to be as efficient as possible.

                My commitment to continuous learning and innovation, especially in artificial intelligence, reflects my
                ambition and can-do spirit. Whether I'm creating new AI solutions or applying them to solve complex
                challenges, I thrive on turning ideas into reality. I take immense pride in my work and excel in
                collaborative, communicative environments that drive success. Outside of work, I channel my energy into
                exploring new destinations and hitting the slopes for a day of skiing.
